						<p>
							Andy Stanier has over two years' experience as a software developer after having 
							completed a master's degree in computer science with distinction.
							With a background in chemistry and 15 years' experience in the pharmaceutical industry,
							Andy is now a proficient and motivated developer using .NET framework software.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having being made redundant from the pharmaceutical industry several times, Andy decided
							to pursue his long-held interest in computer programming.  Having undertaken several
							different online courses in programming and computer science as well as using books and YouTube videos
							to learn new skills, he enrolled in a computer science master's degree at the University of
							Hertfordshire, thus enabling him to gain a recognised formal qualification.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once he had graduated, Andy found a job as a junior web developer using C#, MVC and T-SQL and has 
							since been promoted out of the junior role to a fully-fledged developer.

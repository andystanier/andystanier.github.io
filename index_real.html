					<p>Andy Stanier has recently completed a masters degree in computer science.  
					Originally with a background in chemistry, and with 15 years experience
					in the pharmaceutical industry, upon being made redundant, he decided
					to persue one of his other long-held interests in computer programming.
					</p>
					<p>Having undertaken several different online courses in programming and
					computer science and teaching himself through books and YouTube videos, 
					he signed up to take a masters in computer science from the University of
					Hertfordshire, enabling him to gain a recognised formal qualification.

						<p>
							Andy Stanier has recently completed a master's degree in computer science.
							With a background in chemistry and 15 years' experience in the pharmaceutical industry,
							Andy is an intermediate level programmer in common languages and is
							eager to learn new techniques and languages as required.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having being made redundant from the pharmaceutical industry several times, Andy decided
							to pursue his long-held interest in computer programming.  Having undertaken several
							different online courses in programming and computer science as well as using books and YouTube videos
							to learn new skills, he enrolled in a computer science master's degree at the University of
							Hertfordshire, thus enabling him to gain a recognised formal qualification.
